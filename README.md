# NYC City Bike Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

City Bike is a program that operates in New York City. Its main objectives are to save money, save time, encourage sports, depend and take care of the planet by reducing car use. This program has been successful because it draws the attention not only of citizens but also of tourists who can move around economically, enjoying every corner of the city and interacting with the people there.
From this program and how good a tourist visit feels with that transportation option, the idea of starting a similar project in Des Moines came about. To do this and to convince potential investors, it is essential to carry out a detailed analysis of the base program, which is the NYC City Bike model, and then put together the proposal with the characteristics of Des Moines.
It has been decided to use Tableu to present the analysis.

## Results: 

In a meeting that was held with the investors interested in our project, they suggested us to analyze the NYC citi Bike data for the year 2019 because it is the year before the pandemic and may reflect more accurate data than the most current. We were also asked to give a report on the program for the month of August, which is one of the months with the highest demand because it is a warm and pleasant month to use the bicycle as a means of transport.
The first result obtained was the total number of trips in that month:

As can be seen, the number of trips is quite attractive to invest in a program of this type. Well, it can be seen that it is a program that is well accepted by the population.
The question that arises from this information is what type of users demand this service. To answer this question, we have information on the type of users, including those who have an annual subscription (subscriber) and those who use it occasionally (customer).


[User type] Image 2

As Figure 2 shows, the greatest demand seems to be from New York citizens because 83% of users have an annual subscription, while the rest are occasional users who pay per trip, which gives us the idea that the latter most likely refer to tourists.
With these data at hand, a new concern arises, which is the gender that is most attracted to use the bicycle? The answer to this question will give us ideas to work on marketing.
To solve the previous question we use the following graph:

[User trips by gender] Image 3

It can be seen in image 3 that the majority of users belong to the male gender, are subscribers and also decide to use this service mainly on Thursdays and Fridays.
The information obtained with the previous visualization gives us a much broader and more detailed panorama which allows us to delve deeper into the Citi Bike market since it gives us an idea of ​​the key variables to consider for our project proposal in Des Moines. From the last graph a new question arises, what are the peak hours for this service.
The following visualization is intended to get us closer to the answer to the last question:

[Trips weekday for each hour] Image 4

In this visualization you can see in a general way the hours in which there is greater demand for the service. Although the previous image is good, we can offer a more detailed one with more information that allows us to follow the thread of the story. For this we present the following image:

[Trips by gender-weekday per hour] Image 5

This new image allows us to more widely observe the times and days on which this means of transport is chosen. You can see in the graph that we have the information classified by gender, by hour and by day of the week. With this information, we highlight that the male gender substantially demands this service on Thursdays and Fridays from 5 to 6 in the afternoon. In turn, at a less intense but equally important level, a high demand is registered on Monday and Tuesday at the same time.
The demand in the morning, specifically at 8 am, seems to have a lower level than that of the afternoons, but it also stands out and its behavior is more uniform, since a similar color is observed on all days of the week.
The above information is confirmed by looking at the peak hour data for the month of August, Image 6:

[August Peak hours] Image 6

In this bar chart it can be seen how the schedule from 5pm to 6pm in the afternoon stands out to a great extent compared to the other schedules. Followed by the schedule of 8 am in the morning. The graph also allows us to observe that there is a demand for the service throughout the day, so it is necessary to evaluate at what time the service is least required for the revision and maintenance of the bicycles.
This information is super useful because we have a potential investor who is very interested in our project and who actually asked us for more details about a bike trip. To cover your concerns we decided to add a couple more graphics. The following images show the average duration of a trip by user and by gender.

[Checkout times by users] Image 7

[Checkout times by gender] Image 8

It can be seen that most trips usually last less than an hour. Less than half of all trips take less than two hours, and thus diminishing performance is observed as the hours of use increase.
This information is relevant both to evaluate the number of bicycles available per hour and the amount demanded at specific times, as well as to make a diagnosis of use and establish average times to perform maintenance on the bikes.
So far the report of the NYC Citi bike program.

## Conclusion


With the above, it can be concluded that a robust analysis has been carried out, investigating and breaking down the available data as much as possible. We have decided to present as an overview the first set of 4 graphs that describe the characteristics of the users.

[Overview]Picture 8

And the last 4 graphs as details of the trips. This last set is divided into two pages in the story for a clearer display. Image 9 shows the first of the two.

Additionally, we would like to add that we can go deeper into the model program by taking financial variables and doing the corresponding analysis, and add to our report the creation of a model applied to Des Moines so that investors can feel a little more closely the possible scenarios. .
